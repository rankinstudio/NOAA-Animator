This Python 3.X program lets you view near real-time Level III radar gif's in google earth. It parses radar.weather.gov for the requested transparent gifs then creates a time based animation of the images in Google Earth. 

Generates a KML file based on a timer you select the interval for. Load this KML file into Google Earth as a "Network Link" under "Add" and select a refresh interval.
